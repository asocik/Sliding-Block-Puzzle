# Sliding-Block-Puzzles
Sliding Block Puzzles is a puzzle game similar to Rush Hour implemented with the Java Swing Library. The game consists of a number of pieces that fit into a confined area. The goal is to move one of the pieces, "the goal piece" labeled "Z", to a specific position. Usually, the goal can only be achieved by moving all of the other pieces in a certain specified order of moves. Each piece may be restricted in the direction that it can move (vertically or horizontally).

To play the game just import the project into Eclipse. Make sure the puzzle files are in the working directory.
